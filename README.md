# PopularMovies
A movie collection app based on The MovieDB API. The app shows three possible collections: top rated, most popular and favorites.
Tapping on a movie poster displays the movie info in a new screen. You can add any movie to your Favorites collection by tapping
on the star below the runtime info. Tapping on the star for a movie that is already in the Favorites collection deletes that movie from
the locally stored collection. From this screen, you can launch movie trailers on Youtube, if available, or you can read movie
reviews, if there are any.

NOTE: In order to make the app run, you need to obtain an API key from The MovieDB and insert it into the NetworkUtils.java 
in the marked spot.
